# Create a list of items (you may use either strings or numbers in the list),
# then create an iterator using the iter() function.
#
# Use a for loop to loop "n" times, where n is the number of items of your list.
# Each time round the loop, use next() on your list to print the next item.
#
# hint: use the len() function rather than counting the number of items in the list.

# myList = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"]
# Solution:1
# for i in range(0, len(myList)):
#     next_item = next(myList)
#     print(next_item)
# Solution:2
# for i in myList:
#     print(i)
